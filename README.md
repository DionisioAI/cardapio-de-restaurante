# Menu for a fictional restaurant

This is a static website, that, for now, only has HTML and CSS in its structure. 
But I plan to add some Javascript functionalities to it, as I learn coding. 
This mini-project is designed to be a way to deposit and evolve my few tricks (or knowledge, if you will) of web development. 
Maybe I'll add some database integration to it, although it appears to be too much only for a menu lol
